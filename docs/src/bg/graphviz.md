# Graphviz & DAG visualization

PkgGraph.jl is a glue package: it gathers the package dependency graph, and converts it
to a text format that can be read by a [DAG](@ref) visualization program, which then
does the real work.

We choose to use [Graphviz]'s `dot` as DAG visualizer (i.e. to create the actual
images). `dot` is probably the most well known program for visualizing dependency
graphs.

This page discusses Graphviz, and some possible alternatives.

## Alternatives to Graphviz

### Mermaid & Dagre

'[Mermaid diagrams]' are something more newfangled than Graphviz.
Mermaid uses the [Dagre.js] library for graph layout.

Dagre.js is in part based on `dot`. From their [wiki]:
> The general skeleton for Dagre comes from
> [Gansner, et al., "A Technique for Drawing Directed Graphs"](@ref Gansner1993), 
> which gives both an excellent high level overview of the phases
> involved in layered drawing as well as diving into the details and problems
> of each of the phases. Besides the basic skeleton, we specifically used
> the technique described in the paper to produce an acyclic graph, 
> and we use the network simplex algorithm for ranking. 
> If there is one paper to start with when learning about layered graph drawing,
> this is it!
(See also [mentions of the Gansner paper in Dagre's codebase][mentions]).

Mermaid has prettier default styling than Graphviz.\
But, I find that `dot` does a bit better at graph layout than Mermaid / Dagre.

By choosing Graphviz over Mermaid, we trade-off some styling and style-ability¹ 
for better default DAG layouts.

¹ The default Graphviz style is not awesome, and many effects are infeasible to achieve.
  (See also the critical note in [Styling Graphviz output](@ref) earlier).

### Julia packages for DAG layout

For graph layout and visualization there are [NetworkLayout.jl] (which outputs
coordinates) and [GraphPlot.jl] (which outputs images). Neither work well with long-ish
text labels, nor do they have any specific layout algorithms for DAGs.

## Graphviz today

My impressions from browsing through the [Graphviz Discourse forum] and [their GitLab]:
- Two of the original creators (Emden R. Gansner and Stephen C. North)
  are still engaged with the project (though they are not writing much code anymore)
- There are new maintainers, actively making edits to the codebase at the time of writing.
- The codebase – though working fantastically still in 2022 –
  seems a bit unwieldy to add new features to. See the following quote.

From a [2020 Hacker News comment] by one of the creators (edited):
> We're reluctant to be exposed to too much anger about misfeatures in 20 year old code
> that was basically a prototype that escaped from the lab, [..]
>
> We've gotten a lot of help lately from Magnus Jacobsson, Matthew Fernandez and Mark
> Hansen on cleaning up the website and the code base, even some persistent bugs we
> could never find ourselves.
> 
> Improvements that would benefit the community the most?
> - better default styles that don't look like [troff] from 1985
> - more expressive graph language with classes or templates
> - better documentation to help people find useful tools or just know what they should be looking for
> - it would be a big effort, but move the core algorithms to a framework that supports interaction with layout generation

## The `dot` algorithm in Julia?

A fun project would be to translate the four-step DAG layout algorithm,
described very well in [the original paper](@ref Gansner1993), to Julia.

The code would probably be shorter, and maybe more maintainable,
than [the current C implementation][1].
